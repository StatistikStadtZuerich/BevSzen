*Population scenarios for the city of Zurich*

This [R](https://www.r-project.org/) code is used to generate various population development scenarios for the city of Zurich, Switzerland. The underlying models are based on official population and residential statistics as well as capacity and construction reserve calculations. Documentation can be found [here](5_Documentation).

All necessary data is [Open Data](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/) except the projects as well as the capacity and reserves data.

## Renv
### To users:
We use an [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) enabled RStudio project to manage the local environment with libraries in order to ensure reproducible results, correct working directories etc. You can use the included one or [create your own](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects).  
When you pull this repository, make sure to restart your R session (this is done automatically if you open this as an RStudio project). R will read the project specific `.Rprofile` file and thereby activate `renv`.  
You can also activate it manually by using `renv::activate()`. This might lead to the download of many (potentially older) packages.  
Keep in mind that you will be working in this specific environment as long as you're not switching to another project or manually deactivate renv (`renv::deactivate()`).

### To contributors:
If a new package is required, use `renv::install("new package")`. For updates, use `renv::update("update_package")`.  
Then add this to the lock file by running `renv::snapshot()` and commit the changes in renv.lock. 
A good overview can be found [here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)

## Usage
### To run the population scenarios:

Source [0001_model_control_flow.r](1_Code/0000_General) and run `run_scen()` with the desired modules.

Example: future mortlity rates ("dea" for death), middle scenario

``` r
run_scen( scenarios = "middle", modules = "dea")
```

How to execute the entire model:

``` r
run_scen( scenarios = c("lower", "middle", "upper"), modules = c("all"))
```

**Caveat**: Projects and Capacity and reserves data is currently not publicly available and therefore the respective modules cannot be run. We are working on the open data availability of the respective datasets and hope to be able to provide them soon.
